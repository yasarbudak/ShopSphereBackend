# ShopSphereBackend
ShopSphereBackend: A Microservices-Based E-Commerce Backend in .NET Core. Microservices-based e-commerce backend using .NET Core with modular services for users, orders, and products. Features include JWT authentication and OAuth security.

ShopSphereBackend
Overview
ShopSphereBackend is a microservices-based e-commerce backend built with .NET Core. This project is designed to support a scalable and modular e-commerce platform with separate services for users, orders, and products. The architecture focuses on security, extensibility, and real-time operations, making it ideal for enterprise-level e-commerce solutions.
Features
•	Microservices architecture for modularity and scalability
•	JWT-based authentication and OAuth for security
•	Independent services for user management, product catalog, and order processing
•	Support for future expansion (e.g., additional microservices for payments, reviews)
•	Clean architecture principles (Domain, Application, Infrastructure layers)
•	TDD with unit testing and integration testing
Technologies
•	.NET Core for building APIs
•	Entity Framework Core for data management
•	JWT Authentication for secure access
•	SignalR for real-time features
•	Docker for containerization (future goal)
•	CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment (future goal)
Architecture
This project uses a microservices architecture where each service is decoupled and responsible for a specific part of the business logic. The architecture consists of several layers:
•	API Layer: Manages HTTP requests and responses (e.g., UserService.API)
•	Application Layer: Contains business logic (e.g., UserService.Application)
•	Infrastructure Layer: Manages database connections and external services (e.g., UserService.Infrastructure)
•	Domain Layer: Contains core business entities and logic (e.g., UserService.Domain)
Each microservice follows a similar pattern, ensuring consistency across the entire project.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
•	.NET Core 6.0 SDK or later: Required for building and running the application.
•	SQL Server or PostgreSQL: For database (you can choose based on preference or requirements).
•	Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code: Recommended IDE for development.
Installation
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ShopSphereBackend.git
cd ShopSphereBackend
2.	Build the solution:
dotnet build
3.	Run the migrations (replace with the chosen database):
dotnet ef database update --project ShopSphere.UserService.Infrastructure
4.	Run the project:
dotnet run --project ShopSphere.UserService.API
API Endpoints
•	User Service:
o	GET /api/users: Retrieve all users
o	POST /api/users: Create a new user
o	POST /api/auth/login: Authenticate and get JWT
More endpoints will be added as the project evolves.
Running Tests
The project includes unit tests to ensure quality and maintainability. You can run the tests using the following command:
dotnet test
Roadmap
•	 Set up microservices architecture
•	 Add JWT-based authentication
•	 Implement product and order services
•	 Add real-time notifications using SignalR
•	 Integrate Docker for containerization
•	 Set up CI/CD pipeline
